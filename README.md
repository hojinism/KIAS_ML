# KIAS_ML

## Team Projects
---

### Quick Start
Sorry you have to configure environment yourself...
after installing tensorflow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, blah blah blah
try
```
source setup.sh
cd TeamProject
python run.py --epochs 1
```

### Outline
- Description
- Experiment Setup
- Classical ML
- Quantum ML

### Description

### Experimental Setup
- total 200K x 2 images, 32x32, 2 channels (energy & time)
- train:test = 8:2
- 10% of train set used as validation set
- Freezed parameters (default in run.py)
```python
init_lr = 1e-3
batch_size = 64
epochs = 20
```
might add more?

### Classical CNN
- Baseline CNN model
- wide vs deep
- with / without time info
- transfer learning(for fun?) - maybe ResNet
